# Where is the documentation?

This application does not provide any modules of its own.
It only provides a protocol implementation.

Refer to the [documentation of Arrays](https://hexdocs.pm/arrays/) and the [documentation of Aja](https://hexdocs.pm/aja/) for more information on
using `Arrays` and the `A.Vector`.
